## Scenario: Launching a New Employee Onboarding App

A multinational company wants to improve its employee onboarding process. The goal is to create a streamlined, automated experience for new hires, HR personnel, and IT support teams. The company chooses the Pega Platform to build this solution using the **Pega Express™ delivery approach**.

The Business Architect (BA) plays a central role in guiding the project through the four delivery phases: **Discover**, **Prepare**, **Build**, and **Adopt**. Throughout the process, the BA collaborates with stakeholders, captures requirements using DCO, manages the Case Type Backlog, and ensures the solution aligns with business goals.

## How the BA Engages with Key Concepts in Pega Express

### 1. Directly Capture Objectives (DCO)

**What It Is**:  
DCO is a collaborative technique used to capture business requirements directly in the Pega Platform, typically through App Studio.

**BA's Role in the Scenario**:
- During the **Discover phase**, the BA conducts DCO sessions with HR and IT stakeholders.
- The BA uses App Studio to define the onboarding Microjourney, including stages like:
    - Document collection
    - Training assignment
    - System access provisioning
- The BA captures personas (e.g., New Hire, HR Manager) and their interactions with the system.

**Why It Matters**:
- DCO reduces the need for external documentation.
- It ensures that requirements are captured accurately and in real time.
- It promotes alignment between business and IT teams.

#### Prepare
- Finalize the Case Type Backlog.
- Prioritize features for the MVP.
- Set up environments and teams.

#### Build
- Configure the application in App Studio.
- Validate functionality through iterative testing.

### 3. Case Type Backlog

**What It Is**:  
A prioritized list of features and requirements for a specific case type, used to manage scope and guide development.

**BA's Role in the Scenario**:
- During the **Prepare phase**, the BA creates and manages the backlog for the onboarding case type.
- Prioritized items include:
    - Document upload functionality
    - Training assignment automation
    - Welcome email configuration
- The BA works with stakeholders to define what belongs in the MVP and what can be deferred.

- Helps maintain focus on delivering value quickly.
- Supports agile planning and sprint execution.
- Enables transparent communication with stakeholders.

### 4. Stakeholder Collaboration

**What It Is**:  
Ongoing engagement with business and technical stakeholders to ensure the solution meets real-world needs.

**BA's Role in the Scenario**:
- Facilitates DCO sessions, sprint reviews, and UAT workshops.
- Acts as a bridge between business goals and technical implementation.
