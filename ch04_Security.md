# **Security**
Security in Pega ensures that users access only what they need, based on their roles and responsibilities. This chapter introduces key concepts like personas, operators, and access groups, and explains how they work together to manage user access. You'll also learn the critical difference between authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (controlling access), which is essential for designing secure applications.


## ðŸŸ¨ **1. Relationship Between Personas, Operators, and Access Groups**

### âœ… Definitions:

- **Persona**: A business-friendly abstraction representing a user role or type (e.g., Customer Service Rep, Manager). It defines what a user *does* in the application.
- **Operator**: A specific user account in Pega (e.g., `jsmith@company.com`) that logs into the system.
- **Access Group**: A configuration that links an operator to a specific application, role(s), and portal(s). It controls what the user *can access and do*.

### âœ… How They Relate:

| Concept        | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Persona**     | Represents a role or user type | "Loan Officer" |
| **Operator**    | A specific user login | `lofficer@bank.com` |
| **Access Group**| Grants access to apps, roles, and portals | `LoanOfficer:BankApp` |

- A **persona** is mapped to one or more **access groups**.
- An **operator** is assigned one or more **access groups**, with one set as default.
- Access groups define the **roles**, which in turn define **permissions**.

### âœ… Real-World Example:
In a banking app:
- **Persona**: "Branch Manager"
- **Operator**: `manager@branch.com`
- **Access Group**: Grants access to the "Branch Management" portal and roles like `ManagerRole`, which allows approving loans.

### âœ… Tip:
As a Business Architect, focus on defining **personas and their responsibilities**. Technical teams map these to access groups and roles.

## ðŸŸ¨ **2. Difference Between Authorization and Authentication**

### âœ… Definitions:

| Term | Definition | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Authentication** | Verifies *who* the user is | Login process |
| **Authorization**  | Determines *what* the user can do | Access control |

### âœ… Authentication:
- Ensures the user is legitimate.
- Common methods: username/password, SSO, multi-factor authentication.
- Managed via **authentication services** in Pega.

### âœ… Authorization:
- Controls access to features, data, and UI elements.
- Managed via:
    - **Access Groups** (link to applications and roles)
    - **Access Roles** (define permissions)
    - **Privilege rules** (fine-grained control)
    - **When rules** (conditional visibility)

### âœ… Real-World Example:
- **Authentication**: John logs in using his credentials.
- **Authorization**: Based on his role, he can view customer data but cannot approve loans.

### âœ… Tip:
Remember: **Authentication = Identity**, **Authorization = Permissions**.

## âœ… Summary Tips for Exam Success:

- Understand how **personas** help define user needs and how they map to **access groups**.
- Know that **operators** are actual user accounts, while **access groups** control their access.
- Be able to clearly distinguish between **authentication (login)** and **authorization (permissions)**.
- Expect scenario-based questions where you must identify which security concept is being applied.
