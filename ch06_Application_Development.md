# **Application Development**
Application Development in Pega is a collaborative, agile process that brings together business and technical teams. This chapter outlines the role of the Business Architect, key stakeholders, and tools like App Studio and the Case Type Backlog. You'll learn about Pegaâ€™s Center-outâ„¢ architecture, rule management, generative AI, CI/CD pipelines, and how to manage development through user stories, feedback, and estimation tools.

## ðŸŸ¨ **1. Role and Skills Required of a Pega Business Architect**

### âœ… Role:
A **Pega Business Architect (BA)** bridges the gap between business stakeholders and technical teams. They define business requirements, design case lifecycles, and ensure the solution aligns with business goals.

### âœ… Key Skills:
- **Process modeling** and case design
- **Stakeholder collaboration** and facilitation (e.g., DCO sessions)
- **User story creation** and backlog management
- **Understanding of Pega Express methodology**
- **Basic knowledge of App Studio**, personas, and data modeling

### âœ… Tip:
Focus on **business outcomes**, not technical implementation.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ **2. Identify the Stakeholders on a Pega Project**

### âœ… Common Stakeholders:
- **Business Architect**: Defines requirements and case design
- **System Architect**: Implements technical components
- **Product Owner**: Prioritizes backlog and defines business value
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates agile ceremonies
- **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)**: Provide domain knowledge
- **End Users**: Validate usability and functionality

### âœ… Tip:
Know who contributes during each phase of **Pega Express delivery** (Discover, Prepare, Build, Adopt).

## ðŸŸ¨ **3. Benefits of Pegaâ€™s Center-outâ„¢ Business Architecture**

### âœ… Definition:
**Center-outâ„¢** is a design approach that starts with the **core business logic** (processes, decisions, data) and connects it outward to channels and systems.

### âœ… Benefits:
- **Scalability**: Reuse logic across channels (web, mobile, chatbot)
- **Consistency**: Centralized rules and decisions
- **Agility**: Easier updates and maintenance
- **Customer-centric**: Focuses on outcomes and experiences

### âœ… Real-World Example:
A bank builds a loan approval process once and reuses it across mobile app, web portal, and call center.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ **4. Value of Developing an Application in App Studio**

### âœ… App Studio:
A low-code environment for **Business Architects and Citizen Developers** to design applications collaboratively.

### âœ… Benefits:
- **Visual modeling** of cases, data, personas
- **Real-time collaboration** with SMEs
- **Rapid prototyping** and feedback
- **Simplified deployment** and testing

### âœ… Tip:
Use App Studio for **case design, data modeling, and UI configuration**â€”System Architects can refine in Dev Studio if needed.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ **5. Role of Rules, Rulesets, Classes**

### âœ… Definitions:
- **Rule**: A reusable instruction (e.g., decision table, UI layout, data transform)
- **Ruleset**: A container for related rules, versioned for deployment
- **Class**: Defines the context or scope of a rule (e.g., case type, data object)

### âœ… Real-World Example:
- Rule: Validate loan amount
- Ruleset: `LoanApp:01-01-01`
- Class: `LoanApp-Work-LoanRequest`

### âœ… Tip:
Rulesets support **versioning and reuse**, while classes define **inheritance and organization**.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ **6. Value of Generative AI**

### âœ… Benefits in Pega:
- **Accelerated design**: Generate user stories, personas, and case flows
- **Enhanced productivity**: Draft documentation and UI content
- **Improved decisioning**: Suggest logic based on patterns

### âœ… Tip:
Generative AI supports **ideation and automation**, but human validation is essential.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ **7. Pegaâ€™s CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Manager**

### âœ… CI/CD Pipeline:
Automates **build, test, and deployment** of Pega applications.

### âœ… Deployment Manager:
A tool within Pega that manages:
- **Version control**
- **Automated testing**
- **Environment promotion** (Dev â†’ Test â†’ Prod)

### âœ… Tip:
Business Architects should understand **release cycles** and how changes move through environments.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ **8. Communicate Using Collaboration Tools**

### âœ… Tools:
- **Pulse**: In-app messaging and tagging
- **Spaces**: Group collaboration areas
- **App Studio Feedback**: Capture user comments during testing

### âœ… Tip:
Use Pulse to **tag team members**, share updates, and track decisions.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ **9. Manage Application Development: User Stories, Feedback, Bugs**

### âœ… User Stories:
- Describe business needs in a structured format: *As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [outcome]*.
- Stored in the **Case Type Backlog**

### âœ… Feedback:
- Captured via App Studio or Pulse
- Used to refine requirements

### âœ… Bugs:
- Logged during testing
- Prioritized and tracked in the backlog

### âœ… Tip:
Keep stories **small, testable, and outcome-focused**.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ **10. Use the Case Type Backlog and Estimator Tool to Scope a Pega Platform Project**

### âœ… Case Type Backlog:
- Central place to manage **user stories**, **features**, and **requirements**
- Organized by **Microjourneys**, personas, and stages

### âœ… Estimator Tool:
- Provides **effort estimates** based on selected features
- Helps in **scoping MVPs** and planning sprints

### âœ… Tip:
Use the backlog to **prioritize features** and the estimator to **plan delivery timelines**.
