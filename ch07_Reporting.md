## 🟨 **2. Create Visualizations Using Tables and Charts**

### ✅ Visualization Types:

### ✅ Chart Types Supported:
- Bar chart
- Line chart
- Pie chart
- Donut chart
- Column chart

### ✅ How to Create:
- Select a **data source** (e.g., case type, data object).
- Choose **fields** to display.
- Apply **grouping and aggregation** (e.g., count of cases by status).
- Select a **chart type** based on the data and audience.

### ✅ Real-World Example:
A dashboard shows:
- A **bar chart** of cases by priority
- A **pie chart** of resolved vs unresolved cases
- A **table** listing overdue cases with SLA breaches

### ✅ Tip:
Use charts for **high-level summaries** and tables for **detailed analysis**.

## 🟨 **3. Use Columns, Filters, and Sorting**

### ✅ Columns:
- Represent individual data fields (e.g., Case ID, Status, Assigned To).
- Can be added or removed to customize the report view.

### ✅ Filters:
- Narrow down data based on conditions (e.g., Status = “Open”, Region = “EMEA”).
- Support multiple filter criteria.

### ✅ Sorting:
- Organize data in ascending or descending order (e.g., by Date Created, Priority).
- Helps identify top performers, oldest cases, etc.

### ✅ Real-World Example:
A report on loan applications:
- Columns: Applicant Name, Loan Amount, Status
- Filters: Status = “Pending”, Loan Amount > €10,000
- Sorting: By Loan Amount (descending)

### ✅ Tip:
Use filters and sorting to **focus on actionable data** and reduce noise.
