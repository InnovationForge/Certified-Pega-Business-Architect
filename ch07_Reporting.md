# Chapter 7: Reporting

## Introduction
Reporting in Pega enables users to gain insights into case data, monitor performance, and support decision-making. Business Architects configure reports using App Studio to ensure stakeholders have access to relevant, real-time information.

## Insights
Insights are reusable, role-based reports that display key metrics and trends.

- **Use Cases**:
    - Track open cases by status
    - Monitor SLA compliance
    - View workload by operator

Insights can be embedded in dashboards and portals for easy access.

## Visualizations

Visualizations enhance the readability and impact of reports by presenting data graphically.

- **Types of Visualizations**:
    - **Tables**: Default format for listing records
    - **Bar Charts**: Compare values across categories
    - **Pie Charts**: Show proportions of a whole
    - **Line Charts**: Track trends over time

Choose the visualization type based on the story you want the data to tell.

## Filters

Filters allow users to narrow down report results based on specific criteria.

- **Examples**:
    - Show only cases with status = “Pending”
    - Filter by date range or assigned operator

Filters can be predefined or configured by users at runtime, improving report flexibility and relevance.

## Sorting

Sorting organizes report results in a meaningful order.

- **Examples**:
    - Sort by creation date (newest first)
    - Sort by priority or SLA deadline

Sorting helps users quickly identify the most important or urgent items in a report.

## Dashboards
Dashboards provide a consolidated view of multiple insights and widgets.

- **Use Cases**:
    - Manager dashboards showing team performance
    - Case worker dashboards with assigned tasks and KPIs

Dashboards can be customized per persona to align with role-specific needs.
