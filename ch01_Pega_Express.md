# Chapter 1: Pega Express

## Introduction
Pega Express is a delivery approach that emphasizes rapid, iterative development using App Studio. It promotes collaboration between business and IT stakeholders through Directly Capture Objectives (DCO), enabling faster time-to-value and improved alignment with business goals.

## Pega Express Delivery Phases
The Pega Express methodology is structured into four delivery phases:

1. **Discover** – Understand business outcomes, identify personas, and define microjourneys.
2. **Prepare** – Finalize backlog, define data model, and plan for reuse.
3. **Build** – Configure case types, data objects, and user interfaces using App Studio.
4. **Adopt** – Deploy the application, train users, and monitor adoption.

Each phase is iterative and encourages continuous feedback and refinement.

## Applying DCO in App Studio: Real-World Examples

Directly Capture Objectives (DCO) is a cornerstone of the Pega Express methodology. In App Studio, DCO enables Business Architects to collaborate with stakeholders and rapidly translate business needs into working software. Here are some real-world examples of DCO in action:

- **Example 1: Rapid Case Type Design**  
  During a DCO session, a BA works with a Claims Manager to define a new "Insurance Claim" case type. Using App Studio, the BA captures stages like "Intake," "Review," and "Resolution" live during the session, allowing stakeholders to visualize the process instantly.

- **Example 2: Live Persona Mapping**  
  In a workshop with HR and IT teams, the BA uses App Studio to define personas such as "HR Manager" and "Employee." Access roles and UI views are configured on the spot, ensuring alignment with user expectations.

- **Example 3: Real-Time Field Configuration**  
  While discussing a loan application form, the BA adds fields like "Loan Amount" and "Repayment Term" directly in App Studio. Validation rules and field visibility are configured collaboratively, reducing rework.

These examples demonstrate how DCO in App Studio accelerates delivery, improves stakeholder engagement, and ensures business alignment.

## Best Practices for Stakeholder Collaboration
Effective stakeholder collaboration is essential for successful DCO sessions. Here are key best practices:

- **Prepare with Purpose**: Share agendas and pre-read materials before DCO sessions to align expectations.
- **Facilitate Actively**: Use App Studio as a visual aid to guide discussions and capture feedback in real time.
- **Speak the Stakeholder’s Language**: Avoid technical jargon; focus on outcomes and user experience.
- **Validate Frequently**: Use previews and prototypes to confirm understanding and gain early buy-in.
- **Document Decisions**: Record key agreements and assumptions directly in App Studio or linked documentation.

By following these practices, Business Architects can foster trust, reduce ambiguity, and drive faster consensus.
